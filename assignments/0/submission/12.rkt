;; Exercise 12.
;; ------------
;;
;; Define the function cvolume, which accepts the length of a side of an
;; equilateral cube and computes its volume. If you have time, consider
;; defining csurface, too.
;;
;; Hint An equilateral cube is a three-dimensional container bounded by six
;; squares. You can determine the surface of a cube if you know that the
;; squareâ€™s area is its length multiplied by itself. Its volume is the length
;; multiplied with the area of one of its squares. (Why?) 
;;
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; volume of the cube
(define (cvolume a)
  (* a (* a a)))

;-----------------

; surface of the cube
(define (csurface a)
  (* (sqr a) 6))
