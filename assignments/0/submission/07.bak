;; Exercise 7.
;; -----------

;; Boolean expressions can express some everyday problems. Suppose you want to
;; decide whether today is an appropriate day to go to the mall. You go to the
;; mall either if it is not sunny or if today is Friday (because that is when
;; stores post new sales items).

;; Here is how you could go about it using your new knowledge about Booleans.
;; First add these two lines to the definitions area of DrRacket:

;;    (define sunny #true)
;;    (define friday #false)

;; Now create an expression that computes whether sunny is false or friday is
;; true. So in this particular case, the answer is #false. (Why?)

;; See exercise 1 for how to create expressions in DrRacket. How many
;; combinations of Booleans can you associate with sunny and friday?
