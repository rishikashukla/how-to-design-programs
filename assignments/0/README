Make a directory named how-to-design-programs/

Make racket files:

  1.rkt, 2.rkt, ..., 20.rkt

With exercises 1 to 20 from the book How to Design Programs (2nd edition).




Each file should have the question as a comment, in the following format:


; Exercise 20
; -----------
; Define the function string-delete, which consumes a string plus a number i 
; and deletes the ith position from str. Assume i is a number between 0 (
; inclusive) and the length of the given string (exclusive). See exercise 4 
; for ideas. Can string-delete deal with empty strings? 
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------


(define (string-delete ...)
 ...)





Important: In each file, no line should exceed 80 characters. You can set a 
ruler that warns you when a row exceeds a certain number of characters in the 
DrRacket preferences.
