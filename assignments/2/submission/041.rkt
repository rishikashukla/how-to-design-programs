; Exercise 41.
; ------------
; Finish the sample problem and get the program to run. That is, assuming
; that you have solved exercise 39, define the constants BACKGROUND and Y-CAR.
; Then assemble all the function definitions, including their tests. When your
; program runs to your satisfaction, add a tree to the scenery. We used
;
;    (define tree
;      (underlay/xy (circle 10 "solid" "green")
;                   9 15
;                   (rectangle 2 20 "solid" "brown")))
;
; to create a tree-like shape. Also add a clause to the big-bang expression
; that stops the animation when the car has disappeared on the right side.
