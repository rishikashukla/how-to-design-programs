;; Exercise 9.
;; -----------
;; Add the following line to the definitions area of DrRacket:
;;
;;    (define in ...)
;;
;; Then create an expression that converts the value of in to a positive number.
;; For a String, it determines how long the String is; for an Image, it uses the
;; area; for a Number, it decrements the number by 1, unless it is already 0 or
;; negative; for #true it uses 10 and for #false 20.
;;
;; See exercise 1 for how to create expressions in DrRacket.
