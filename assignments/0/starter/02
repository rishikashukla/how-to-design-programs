;; Exercise 2.
;; -----------
;; Add the following two lines to the definitions area:
;;
;;    (define prefix "hello")
;;    (define suffix "world" )
;;
;; Then use string primitives to create an expression that concatenates prefix and
;; suffix and adds "_" between them. When you run this program, you will see
;; "hello_world" in the interactions area.
;;
;; See exercise 1 for how to create expressions using DrRacket.
