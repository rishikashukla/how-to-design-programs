; Exercise 39.
; ------------
; Good programmers ensure that an image such as CAR can be enlarged or reduced
; via a single change to a constant definition.
; We started the development of our car image with a single plain definition:
;
;    (define WHEEL-RADIUS 5)
;
; The definition of WHEEL-DISTANCE is based on the wheel’s radius. Hence,
; changing WHEEL-RADIUS from 5 to 10 doubles the size of the car image. This
; kind of program organization is dubbed single point of control, and good
; design employs this idea as much as possible.
;
; Develop your favorite image of an automobile so that WHEEL-RADIUS remains the
; single point of control.
