;; Exercise 8.
;; -----------

;; Add the following line to the definitions area:

;;    (define cat <image of the cat>)

;; Create a conditional expression that computes whether the image is tall or
;; wide. An image should be labeled "tall" if its height is larger than or equal
;; to its width; otherwise it is "wide". See exercise 1 for how to create such
;; expressions in DrRacket; as you experiment, replace the cat with a rectangle
;; of your choice to ensure that you know the expected answer.

;; Now try the following modification. Create an expression that computes
;; whether a picture is "tall", "wide", or "square".
